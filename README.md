# About
Hello. This is the **St. Louis Zoo Animal Logger** project that I built as my first community project in the [**Spark**](http://parkwayspark.com/) program.

This project helps zookeepers and staff better monitor their animals in a digital format through an online application. This is an alternative to the standard format which is

` paper-form -> digital-form`

# Features

* Select an animal to observe (For now just Red Panda)
* Log Feeding information and time
* Log the status of the animal
* Log the behavior of the animal (written)
* Sends an email of the logs to a email address

# Todo

- [ ] Scrape St.Louis Zoo website for rest of animals

- [ ] Add ability to sends animal logs to a server instead of just an email

- [ ] Set up a dedicated email for the application (e.g animalregistrydummy@example.com)
